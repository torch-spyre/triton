# Three reductions are supported through ``OP: tl.constexpr``: ``sum``, ``max``
# and ``min``. They are the three that lower: each becomes a ``linalg.reduce``
# differing only in its combiner (addf/addi, maxnumf/maxsi, minnumf/minsi), and
# all three run on ``ktir_cpu`` at fp16, fp32 and i32. What separates them is the
# device: the dataflow scheduler resets a reduction accumulator to zero whatever
# the combiner is, so only ``sum`` has the right neutral element -- see the
# Level D banner in ``meta.py``.

    core iterates its assigned D0-blocks, loads a [BLOCK_D0, D1, D2] tile and
    reduces over the middle (D1) axis to produce a [BLOCK_D0, D2] result.

    With three distinct extents, reducing the wrong axis fails loudly — the
    output shape changes. What the lowering does about the reduced axis not
    being trailing is: nothing. ``linalg.reduce`` names the axes it folds in a
    sorted ``dimensions`` list, so D1 is reduced where it sits and no
    ``linalg.transpose`` is emitted, at either grid and with or without a stick
    layout -- which is what ``meta.py`` asserts with
    ``assert_absent("linalg.transpose")``.

    The counterpart of ``elementwise_1d_device``, and it exists for the same
    reason: every other kernel here carves work across the grid with an
    ``scf.for`` over the program id, and dbo-opt rejects the loop that is
    outlined from it. Removing the loop is what makes any *reduce*-specific
    device refusal visible, rather than the loop refusal every variant shares.

    ``AXIS`` selects which axis of ``[M, N]`` is folded away, and it is a
    parameter because the two answers are not the same case once the input is
    stick-tiled on N -- which is where a reduce's device story is decided:

    - ``AXIS=0`` folds M, a *whole physical dimension*. The stick structure
      survives untouched, and because the output descriptor declares exactly the
      layout that leaves, the reduce is emitted at physical shape: one
      ``linalg.reduce`` whose surviving stick index is a batch dimension
      (``ins tensor<2x64x64> outs tensor<2x64> dimensions = [1]``), which is the
      shape torch-spyre's working ``sum`` emits. This one reaches a binary and
      launches.
    - ``AXIS=1`` folds N, the *stick* axis. Stick-on-N splits N across physical
      dimensions 0 and 2, so the reduce names both and collapses to a rank-1
      result that then has to be widened back for a rank-2 store. No batch
      dimension survives to carry the split. torch-spyre does not emit
      ``linalg.reduce`` for this at all -- its ``sum-onstick`` case uses
      ``linalg.generic`` with the maps written out, because the lanes are read as
      one dimension and written as another. It still stops in the scheduler; the
      Level D banner in ``meta.py`` says where.

    They stop in different places, which is the point of being able to ask for
    both. ``AXIS`` also makes the output extent vary, so the variant states no
    output shape: it follows from the axis.
